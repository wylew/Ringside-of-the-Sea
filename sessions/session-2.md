Title: The Shattered Isles

Session 2 took us into dangerous waters as we pursued the Tide Callers to their base in the Shattered Isles.

## :star2: Key Events

- **The Sea Chase**: An intense ship combat where Mira took the helm and pulled off impossible maneuvers
- **The Kraken Attack**: A young kraken, apparently allied with the Tide Callers, ambushed us mid-journey
- **Kaelen's Revelation**: During the kraken fight, Kaelen displayed mysterious water-controlling abilities they didn't know they had

## :disguised_face: NPCs Introduced

- **Captain Seraphina Vale**: A rival pirate captain who offered to help us (for a price)
- **The Kraken**: Not killed, but driven away. It will remember us.

## :open_book: Cliffhanger

We discovered the Tide Callers aren't just pirates—they're trying to awaken an ancient sea deity. And Kaelen might be the key to stopping them... or helping them.

Kaelen: Did anyone else notice that shopkeeper was acting strange?
Mira: Very strange. He kept looking at the door like he was expecting someone.
Theron: Or afraid someone would walk in...
Mira: We should investigate after we rest.

Theron: We need to talk about what happened back there with the water.
Mira: What's there to talk about? We survived.
Theron: Barely! And only because Kaelen did... whatever that was.
Kaelen: I told you, I don't know what happened. One moment I was drowning, the next...
Mira: The next, the water was obeying you like a trained dog.
Kaelen: It wasn't like that.
Theron: Then what was it like?
Kaelen: It felt like... like coming home.

That bird wasn't alive so TECHNICALLY I didn't kill it.
