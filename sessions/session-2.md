**Mulduck** meets up with **Clovis** and the ship crew who are watching **Quulaihr** who is holding a glowing seagull 🐦. 

Quulaihr, however, is having a converstaion with a god, **Bembem** 😇, through the bird, though it just looks like a bird to all of us. Quulaihr is signing a contract to become a follower of Bembem.

**Mulduck, Clovis and Quulaihr** make their way to the cargo deck to find a gigantic venus fly trap 🪴 has taken up residence in the corner with vines and flower growing all over the walls and ceiling. Quulaihr attacks it right away.

Mulduck and Quulaihr go to the store **Well Gotten Gains** 🛡️ where the shop keep clearly knows Mulduck from somewhere and is hiding it. Mulduck remains **invisible**. Quulaihr fails terribly to convince the shop keep Bianca that he's from temple **Path of Twilight** 🛕 prompting her to share information about Mulducks bounty out of pity. Mulduck is wanted by those of the Path of Twilight, a temple of Celestial mages and general space worshippers in Yyiros.

Quulaihr buys plate armor 🦾 before they leave.

Luigi and Clovis go to the fancy bar, **Salt & Air** 🍹 to seek further information about Luigi's bounty, they speak to the bartender and he mentions that there are mages from a town called Tieem that has been an irritant as their highly arrogant. They are also mages from New Haven and largely they're fine with the locals.

Luigi knows Tieem, as it houses the magic school he previously attended...

Clovis, pretending to be drunk sparks up a conversation with some of the mages from Tieem, Gem and Crystal, asking if anyone knows about a man named Luigi. He learns that Luigi is infamous as he killed the headmaster of the mage school and fled, and now one of his prior classmates is in charge. Of the two mages I was chatting up, one of them, Gem, gives me their number 😉

Luigi is wanted for killing **Denton Fellridge** 🧙‍♂️. **Zim Grayson** 🧙‍♂️ is now headmaster.
